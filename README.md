### About
Iam a Software Engineer graduated from University of Technology - Baghdad in 2009 with passion to be a big web develper , I started to create websites since 2006 when I was in high school , from that day I dedicated my time to learn more and more, once I saw a quote says , If you want to Learn someting ,teach it. So I started to post Web programming tutorials on Youtube to give knowledge we have for free.
